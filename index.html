            <div id="content" style="display: none;">

            <p id="intro">For the past decade, I've honed my skills in the banking industry, taking on roles in sales,
                leadership, technological education, home loan processing, and more. My journey has taken me through
                various positions at Bristol City Hall, Santander Bank, Winn Dixie, and Outback, where I consistently
                held supervisory roles. I decided to make the change from my career in search to pursue my growing passion
                for creating amazing sites for the future.</p>
            <h4><strong>My Educational Background:</strong></h4>

            <p id="education">I graduated from Bristol Central High School in 2012 and pursued further education at
                Tunxis Community College. I am currently in the process of graduating from FlatIron Academy to become a
                full stack software engineer. I have created multiple websites and applications; in the process my development 
                has grown exponentially allowing me to find particular aspects of programming that bring me great joy and intrigue! </p>
                <br/>
                <p className="list"> A list of deployed projects you can peruse!
                    <br/>

                    1:<a className="projectlinks" href="https://achi11ean.github.io/phase1Project/">Gweather</a>: an LGBTQIA+ website built around the concept of Provincetown RI and why it is a renown haven for people who are part of the community. This was built 
                    using HTML/CSS/JS front end that accesses data from a public API using JSON-server. This project returns a collection of objects with each object having multiple attributes. 
                    This is a single page with no redirectos or reloads. It incorporates event listeners and iterations. I had a lot of fun figuring out CSS for this project.   
                    <br/>
                    2: <a  href="https://main--potterpals.netlify.app/">PotterHub</a>: a compendium of Harry Potter Characters and spells that you can use to find niche information on the movies, books, characters and spells as well as have the ability to create your own spells and characters!
                    This was built using a single page application with Vite. This project contains several components, multiple client side routes, and a nav bar. 
                    <br/>
                    3: <a  href="https://github.com/Achi11ean/Final-Project">CLI Event Planner</a>:The Performance Event Planner is a Python-based command-line interface application designed to help: local artists manage events, tours and build a fan following as well as find venues to perform at based on details.;
                    It Helps local venues find artists to perform for them and to see data on attendees to help cater events to popular demand. Venues can also create events and tours to promote them.
                    Lastly it helps attendees to find local events/tours in the area, follow artists to different shows or follow venues to see their events and who is performing at them.
                    <br/>
                    I personally created this to track my singing performances and friends and family that helped support me along the way!
                    The application allows users to GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE based on their intended use of the database All through the terminal!
                    I became so passionate about this project and determined to be able to share it with people who aren't technically inclined so i let this project guide me into the next phase of learning.

            <h4><strong>A Lifelong Passion for Technology:</strong></h4>

            <p id="passion">Technology and gadgets have fascinated me since childhood. From playing with a PDA as a kid
                to enjoying video games as an adult, this early interest has evolved into a deep passion for learning
                and mastering computer coding. Coding was the language I was born to speak, I look forward to seeing how this becomes an extension of myself indiscernible to my own thoughts and hands. </p>
            <h4><strong>Why Software Development?</strong></h4>

            <p id="why">My enthusiasm for technology naturally led me to software development. I had a friend who mentioned how he does computer coding and how it's changed his life for the better and it inspired me to think I might be capable of something as complex and exapnding as software development. 
                I love the challenge of coding and the opportunity it provides to create solutions that improve how people interact with the
                internet and truthfully, the world. I'm excited to apply my skills to help others navigate and utilize technology more
                effectively and most importantly grow my skills until i'm able to assist in the renaissance that the internet is currently entering. I look forward to building not only applications for today, but applications for the future. </p>

            <h4><strong>Creative Pursuits</strong></h4>

            <p id="Pursuits">Beyond my professional life, I have a vibrant creative side. I'm actively involved in
                community theatre as an actor, singer, and dancer, and I also contribute to the digital marketing team
                to help promote our shows. Social media is another area of interest, and for the past two years, I've
                enjoyed hosting karaoke events. In my spare time, I write poetry, which allows me to express my thoughts
                and creativity in a different medium. I enjoy helping friends and enjoying nature, staying fit and healthy as well as being an uncle to amazing kids. </p>

            <h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
            <p id="journey">As part of my software engineering studies, I've been immersing myself in a variety of web
                development technologies. I've gained proficiency in JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, SQL [+Alchemy], HTML, and  so far some of my favorite :CSS. These all form the backbone
                of my coding toolkit.  Additionally, I've become adept at using GitHub for version
                control and collaboration, and VS Code has become my go-to code editor for its versatility and powerful
                features. This continuous learning journey has been both challenging and rewarding, equipping me with
                the skills to build and enhance web applications effectively -- and to think: i'm still just getting started!</p>
