            <h2>Extra Extra! Read All About IT!</h2>
            <h3>Hi there! I'm Jonathen Whitford, and welcome to my software development portfolio.</h3>
            <p id="intro">For the past decade, I've honed my skills in the banking industry, taking on roles in sales,
                leadership, technological education, home loan processing, and more. My journey has taken me through
                various positions at Bristol City Hall, Santander Bank, Winn Dixie, and Outback, where I consistently
                held supervisory roles.</p>
            <h4><strong>My Educational Background:</strong></h4>

            <p id="education">I graduated from Bristol Central High School in 2012 and pursued further education at
                Tunxis Community College. Currently, I'm enrolled at Flatiron Academy, specializing in software
                engineering.</p>

            <h4><strong>A Lifelong Passion for Technology:</strong></h4>

            <p id="passion">Technology and gadgets have fascinated me since childhood. From playing with a PDA as a kid
                to enjoying video games as an adult, this early interest has evolved into a deep passion for learning
                and mastering computer coding.</p>
            <h4><strong>Why Software Development?</strong></h4>

            <p id="why">My enthusiasm for technology naturally led me to software development. I love the challenge of
                coding and the opportunity it provides to create solutions that improve how people interact with the
                internet. I'm excited to apply my skills to help others navigate and utilize technology more
                effectively.</p>

            <h4><strong>Creative Pursuits</strong></h4>

            <p id="Pursuits">Beyond my professional life, I have a vibrant creative side. I'm actively involved in
                community theatre as an actor, singer, and dancer, and I also contribute to the digital marketing team
                to help promote our shows. Social media is another area of interest, and for the past two years, I've
                enjoyed hosting karaoke events. In my spare time, I write poetry, which allows me to express my thoughts
                and creativity in a different medium.</p>

            <h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
            <p id="journey">As part of my software engineering studies, I've been immersing myself in a variety of web
                development technologies. I've gained proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which form the backbone
                of my coding toolkit. Learning to manipulate the DOM has been particularly exciting, allowing me to
                create dynamic and interactive web pages. Additionally, I've become adept at using GitHub for version
                control and collaboration, and VS Code has become my go-to code editor for its versatility and powerful
                features. This continuous learning journey has been both challenging and rewarding, equipping me with
                the skills to build and enhance web applications effectively.</p>
